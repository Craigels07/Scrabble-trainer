# Scrabble-trainer
This project is intended to help eccentric Scrabble players enhance their vocabulary and word recognition skills. The Python program takes a sentence as an input and replaces each word in the sentence with another word starting with the same letter that is the same length. If a particular word isn't found, the original word is returned.

## Resources
