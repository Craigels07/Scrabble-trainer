# Scrabble-trainer
This project is intended to help eccentric Scrabble players enhance their vocabulary and word recognition skills. The Python program takes a sentence as an input and replaces each word in the sentence with another word starting with the same letter that is the same length. If a particular word isn't found, the original word is returned.

## Resources 
The word list contains 370,000 words used to help prepare for Scrabble matches and is found here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt. Note I do not own this list, I only made use of it to help train eccentric Scrabble players using this project.
